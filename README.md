CUPS filter for thermal printer Excelvan ZJ-8001

it's a modified version of klirichek's ZJ-58 cups for a 80mm thermal printer

We have worked with @redfish4ktc on this and we have been able to make the zj-80 printer work by modifying the rastertozj.c driver
The value has been modified on line 260.
